# VBA-challenge

For this challenge, I collaborated with classmates outside of TA hours (in a study group) to help each other try to correct mistakes throughout the code & stayed during office hours to have questions answered and to listen to others questions being answered.

I researched on Google & utilizied https://www.educba.com/vba-max/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27065840/meaning-of-cells-rows-count-a-endxlup-row, & https://www.excelcampus.com/vba/find-last-row-column-cell/ to find functions as well as verify/troubleshoot errors.

The file contains the following:

1. VBA CODE: Sub TickerStockData():.vb 
2. EXCEL SHEET: MultpleYearStockDataExcel.xls
3. RESULTS: 3 Screenshots
